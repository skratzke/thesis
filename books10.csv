Not a Penny More Not a Penny Less,"Archer, Jeffrey *","In Jeffrey Archer's book **""Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less,""** there are few female characters, and none of them play a central or main role in the plot. The book primarily focuses on a group of male characters—such as an Oxford professor, a Harley Street physician, an art dealer, and a British aristocrat—who are victims of a stock scam and plot to retrieve their money[1][4][5].

One of the few female characters mentioned is **Anne**, who serves as the love interest of James, one of the four male protagonists. However, she is not developed as a main character and plays a limited role in the story[4].

Therefore, the book does not feature a female main character. The narrative revolves around the male protagonists and their efforts to outwit the swindler, Harvey Metcalfe."

Max Havelaar or the Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company,Multatuli,"The novel **""Max Havelaar or the Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company""** by Multatuli does not feature a female main character in the traditional sense. The primary protagonist of the novel is **Max Havelaar**, a Dutch colonial official. While his wife, **Tine Havelaar** (also known as ""Poesje""), is a significant character, she is not the central figure driving the narrative. Her role is important but secondary to Max's story and his fight against corruption within the colonial system[1][2][4].

In adaptations or reinterpretations, such as **""Max Havelaar with Zombies""**, Tine's role is expanded, making her more active and vivid, but these are not part of the original novel[3]. Therefore, in the context of the original book by Multatuli, there is no female main character."
First Love,"Turgenev, Ivan","In ""First Love"" by Ivan Turgenev, the story does not feature a female main character in the sense that she is the sole protagonist. However, **Princess Zinaida Alexandrovna Zasyekin** plays a central role in the plot and is indeed a pivotal figure throughout the novel. She is the twenty-one-year-old object of **Vladimir Petrovich's** affections and is portrayed as intelligent, beautiful, and capricious, commanding attention from multiple suitors[1][3]. Although Vladimir is the narrator and protagonist, Zinaida's character drives much of the narrative's emotional and thematic developments, making her a key character if not the main one[1][5]. 

Thus, while the book does not have a female main character in the traditional sense, Zinaida's role is crucial and central to the story's exploration of love, identity, and societal dynamics."
Ship Breaker Ship Breaker 1,"Bacigalupi, Paolo *","**""Ship Breaker""** by Paolo Bacigalupi does not feature a female main character as the central protagonist.

She is crucial to the plot, as her rescue sets many events in motion, but she is not the main character. Another female character, **Pima**, is Nailer's close friend and also plays a meaningful role, but she is more of a supporting character than a central one[1][2][3][5]. Therefore, while female characters like Nita and Pima contribute significantly to the narrative, they do not replace Nailer as the main protagonist."
